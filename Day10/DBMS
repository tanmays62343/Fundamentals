Aggregation
In aggregation, the relation between two entities is treated as a single entity. 
In aggregation, relationship with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity.

Relationship of higher degree
The degree of relationship can be defined as the number of occurrences in one entity that is associated with the number of occurrences in another entity.

There is the three degree of relationship:

One-to-one (1:1)
One-to-many (1:M)
Many-to-many (M:N)

1. One-to-one
In a one-to-one relationship, one occurrence of an entity relates to only one occurrence in another entity.
A one-to-one relationship rarely exists in practice.

2. One-to-many
In a one-to-many relationship, one occurrence in an entity relates to many occurrences in another entity.

3. Many-to-many
In a many-to-many relationship, many occurrences in an entity relate to many occurrences in another entity.
Same as a one-to-one relationship, the many-to-many relationship rarely exists in practice.
