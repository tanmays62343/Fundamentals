Keys
Keys play an important role in the relational database.
It is used to uniquely identify any record or row of data from the table. 
It is also used to establish and identify relationships between tables.

Types of Keys - 

1. Primary key
It is the first key used to identify one and only one instance of an entity uniquely.

2. Candidate key
A candidate key is an attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.
Except for the primary key, the remaining attributes are considered a candidate key.The candidate keys are as strong as the primary key.

3. Super Key
Super key is an attribute set that can uniquely identify a tuple. A super key is a superset of a candidate key.

4. Foreign key
Foreign keys are the column of the table used to point to the primary key of another table.

5. Alternate key
There may be one or more attributes or a combination of attributes that uniquely identify each tuple in a relation. 
These attributes or combinations of the attributes are called the candidate keys. 
One key is chosen as the primary key from these candidate keys, and the remaining candidate key, if it exists, is termed the alternate key.

6. Composite key
Whenever a primary key consists of more than one attribute, it is known as a composite key. This key is also known as Concatenated Key.

7. Artificial key
The key created using arbitrarily assigned data are known as artificial keys. 
These keys are created when a primary key is large and complex and has no relationship with many other relations. 
The data values of the artificial keys are usually numbered in a serial order.
