Relational Algebra
Relational algebra is a procedural query language. It gives a step by step process to obtain the result of the query. 
It uses operators to perform queries.

1. Select Operation:
The select operation selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate.
It is denoted by sigma (σ).
Notation:  σ p(r)

2. Project Operation:
This operation shows the list of those attributes that we wish to appear in the result. 
Rest of the attributes are eliminated from the table.
It is denoted by ∏.

3. Union Operation:
Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The union operation contains all the tuples that are either in R or S or both in R & S.
It eliminates the duplicate tuples. It is denoted by ∪.
Notation: R ∪ S   

4. Set Intersection:
Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The set intersection operation contains all tuples that are in both R & S.
It is denoted by intersection ∩.
Notation: R ∩ S

5. Set Difference:
Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The set intersection operation contains all tuples that are in R but not in S.
It is denoted by intersection minus (-).
Notation: R - S

6. Cartesian product
The Cartesian product is used to combine each row in one table with each row in the other table. It is also known as a cross product.
It is denoted by X.
Notation: E X D  

7. Rename Operation:
The rename operation is used to rename the output relation. It is denoted by rho (ρ).
