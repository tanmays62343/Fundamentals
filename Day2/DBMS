RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL, and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.
It is called Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) because it is based on the relational model introduced by E.F. Codd.

How it works

Data is represented in terms of tuples (rows) in RDBMS.
A relational database is the most commonly used database. It contains several tables, and each table has its primary key.
Due to a collection of an organized set of tables, data can be accessed easily in RDBMS.

What is table/Relation?

Everything in a relational database is stored in the form of relations. 
The RDBMS database uses tables to store data. A table is a collection of related data entries and contains rows and columns to store data.
Each table represents some real-world objects such as person, place, or event about which information is collected. 
The organized collection of data into a relational table is known as the logical view of the database.
