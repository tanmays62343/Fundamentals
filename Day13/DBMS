Join Operations:
A Join operation combines related tuples from different relations, if and only if a given join condition is satisfied. It is denoted by ⋈.

Types of Join operations:

1. Natural Join:
A natural join is the set of tuples of all combinations in R and S that are equal on their common attribute names.
It is denoted by ⋈.

2. Outer Join:
The outer join operation is an extension of the join operation. It is used to deal with missing information.

An outer join is basically of three types:
Left outer join
Right outer join
Full outer join

a. Left outer join:
Left outer join contains the set of tuples of all combinations in R and S that are equal on their common attribute names.
In the left outer join, tuples in R have no matching tuples in S.
It is denoted by ⟕.

b. Right outer join:
Right outer join contains the set of tuples of all combinations in R and S that are equal on their common attribute names.
In right outer join, tuples in S have no matching tuples in R.
It is denoted by ⟖.

Full outer join:
Full outer join is like a left or right join except that it contains all rows from both tables.
In full outer join, tuples in R that have no matching tuples in S and tuples in S that have no matching tuples in R in their common attribute name.
It is denoted by ⟗.
