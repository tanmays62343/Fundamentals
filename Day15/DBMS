Functional Dependency
The functional dependency is a relationship that exists between two attributes. It typically exists between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table.
X   →   Y  
The left side of FD is known as a determinant, the right side of the production is known as a dependent.

Types of Functional dependency

1. Trivial functional dependency
A → B has trivial functional dependency if B is a subset of A.
The following dependencies are also trivial like: A → A, B → B

2. Non-trivial functional dependency
A → B has a non-trivial functional dependency if B is not a subset of A.
When A intersection B is NULL, then A → B is called as complete non-trivial.
