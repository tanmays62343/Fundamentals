Relational Model concept
Relational model can represent as a table with columns and rows. Each row is known as a tuple. 
Each table of the column has a name or attribute.

Domain: It contains a set of atomic values that an attribute can take.

Attribute: It contains the name of a column in a particular table. Each attribute Ai must have a domain, dom(Ai)

Relational instance: In the relational database system, the relational instance is represented by a finite set of tuples. Relation instances do not have duplicate tuples.

Relational schema: A relational schema contains the name of the relation and name of all columns or attributes.

Relational key: In the relational key, each row has one or more attributes. It can identify the row in the relation uniquely.

Properties of Relations -
Name of the relation is distinct from all other relations.
Each relation cell contains exactly one atomic (single) value
Each attribute contains a distinct name
Attribute domain has no significance
tuple has no duplicate value
Order of tuple can have a different sequence
