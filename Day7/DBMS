ER model -
ER model stands for an Entity-Relationship model. It is a high-level data model. This model is used to define the data elements and relationship for a specified system.
It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a very simple and easy to design view of data.
In ER modeling, the database structure is portrayed as a diagram called an entity-relationship diagram.

1. Entity:
An entity may be any object, class, person or place. In the ER diagram, an entity can be represented as rectangles.
Consider an organization as an example- manager, product, employee, department etc. can be taken as an entity.

2. Attribute
The attribute is used to describe the property of an entity. Eclipse is used to represent an attribute.
For example, id, age, contact number, name, etc. can be attributes of a student.

3. Relationship
A relationship is used to describe the relation between entities. Diamond or rhombus is used to represent the relationship.


Mapping Constraints -
A mapping constraint is a data constraint that expresses the number of entities to which another entity can be related via a relationship set.
It is most useful in describing the relationship sets that involve more than two entity sets.
For binary relationship set R on an entity set A and B, there are four possible mapping cardinalities. These are as follows:
One to one (1:1)
One to many (1:M)
Many to one (M:1)
Many to many (M:M)
